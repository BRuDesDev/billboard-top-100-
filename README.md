# Billboard Top 100 Time Machine

A Python script that takes input (a date) from user, scrapes the Billboard Top 100 for the week of date, and creates a Spotify playlist of those 100 songs.

This script is not meant to work for other people. In this script I had to use my Spotify account to have playlist made, and therefore would need original client_id and client_secret to work.

Here is a picture of the Spotofy playlist created by my code:
